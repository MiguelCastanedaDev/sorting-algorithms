# sorting-algorithms
This project has the purpose of showing in detail the functionality of different sorting algorithms,
such as the time of its execution and the procedure of how each algorithm orders the data.

Computer algorithms are sets of logical, sequential instructions that a computer can follow to perform
a specific task. These algorithms can be used to solve mathematical problems, process information, control
devices and perform many other tasks. Algorithms are essential for the functioning of computers and are used
in a wide variety of applications, from data science to machine learning and artificial intelligence.

Understanding this, the ordering algorithms are a set of techniques and procedures that are used to order a set of data and
There are several different sorting algorithms, each with its own characteristics and applications.
